   * Locating Fraction on a Number Line\\
Hannula, Markku S.

International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, Paper presented at the 27th International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education Conference Held Jointly with the 25th PME-NA Conference (Honolulu, HI, Jul 13-18, 2003), v3 p17-24
Based on a survey of 3067 Finnish 5th and 7th graders and a task-based interview of 20 7th graders we examine student's understanding of fraction. Two tasks frame a specific fraction (3/4) in different contexts: as part of an eight-piece bar (area context) and as a location on a number line. The results suggest that students' understanding of fraction develops substantially from 5th to 7th grade. However, Part-to-Whole comparison is strongly dominating students' thinking, and students have difficulties in perceiving a fraction as a number on a number line even on 7th grade.
