====== Formatting Syntax ======

Primeiro $E = mc^2$.

===== Basic Text Formatting =====

DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, __underlined__ and ''monospaced'' texts. Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these.

  Of course you can **__//''combine''//__** all these.

You can use <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>, too.

You can mark something as <del>deleted</del> as well.

  You can mark something as <del>deleted</del> as well.

**Paragraphs** are created from blank lines. If you want to **force a newline** without a paragraph, you can use two backslashes followed by a whitespace or the end of line.

This is some text with some linebreaks\\ Note that the
two backslashes are only recognized at the end of a line\\
or followed by\\ a whitespace \\this happens without it.

You should use forced newlines only if really needed.

===== Links =====

DokuWiki supports multiple ways of creating links.

==== External ====

External links are recognized automagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com - You can set the link text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to google]]. Email addresses like this one: <andi@splitbrain.org> are recognized, too.


  This links to [[syntax#internal|this Section]].

Notes:

  * Links to [[syntax|existing pages]] are shown in a different style from [[nonexisting]] ones.
  * DokuWiki does not use [[wp>CamelCase]] to automatically create links by default, but this behavior can be enabled in the [[doku>config]] file. Hint: If DokuWiki is a link, then it's enabled.
  * When a section's heading is changed, its bookmark changes, too. So don't rely on section linking too much.

===== Sectioning =====

You can use up to five different levels of headlines to structure your content. If you have more than three headlines, a table of contents is generated automatically -- this can be disabled by including the string ''<nowiki>~~NOTOC~~</nowiki>'' in the document.

==== Headline Level 3 ====
=== Headline Level 4 ===
== Headline Level 5 ==

  ==== Headline Level 3 ====
  === Headline Level 4 ===
  == Headline Level 5 ==

By using four or more dashes, you can make a horizontal line:

==== Supported Media Formats ====

DokuWiki can embed the following media formats directly.

| Image | ''gif'', ''jpg'', ''png''  |
| Video | ''webm'', ''ogv'', ''mp4'' |
| Audio | ''ogg'', ''mp3'', ''wav''  |
| Flash | ''swf''                    |

===== Lists =====

Dokuwiki supports ordered and unordered lists. To create a list item, indent your text by two spaces and use a ''*'' for unordered lists or a ''-'' for ordered ones.

  * This is a list
  * The second item
    * You may have different levels
  * Another item

  - The same list but ordered
  - Another item
    - Just use indention for deeper levels
  - That's it

Also take a look at the [[doku>faq:lists|FAQ on list items]].

===== Tables =====

DokuWiki supports a simple syntax to create tables.

^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2       ^ Heading 3          ^
| Row 1 Col 1    | Row 1 Col 2     | Row 1 Col 3        |
| Row 2 Col 1    | some colspan (note the double pipe) ||
| Row 3 Col 1    | Row 3 Col 2     | Row 3 Col 3        |

Table rows have to start and end with a ''|'' for normal rows or a ''^'' for headers.

  ^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2       ^ Heading 3          ^
  | Row 1 Col 1    | Row 1 Col 2     | Row 1 Col 3        |
  | Row 2 Col 1    | some colspan (note the double pipe) ||
  | Row 3 Col 1    | Row 3 Col 2     | Row 3 Col 3        |

To connect cells horizontally, just make the next cell completely empty as shown above. Be sure to have always the same amount of cell separators!

Vertical tableheaders are possible, too.

|              ^ Heading 1            ^ Heading 2          ^
^ Heading 3    | Row 1 Col 2          | Row 1 Col 3        |
^ Heading 4    | no colspan this time |                    |
^ Heading 5    | Row 2 Col 2          | Row 2 Col 3        |

As you can see, it's the cell separator before a cell which decides about the formatting:

  |              ^ Heading 1            ^ Heading 2          ^
  ^ Heading 3    | Row 1 Col 2          | Row 1 Col 3        |
  ^ Heading 4    | no colspan this time |                    |
  ^ Heading 5    | Row 2 Col 2          | Row 2 Col 3        |

You can have rowspans (vertically connected cells) by adding ''%%:::%%'' into the cells below the one to which they should connect.

^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2                  ^ Heading 3          ^
| Row 1 Col 1    | this cell spans vertically | Row 1 Col 3        |
| Row 2 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        |
| Row 3 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        |

Apart from the rowspan syntax those cells should not contain anything else.

  ^ Heading 1      ^ Heading 2                  ^ Heading 3          ^
  | Row 1 Col 1    | this cell spans vertically | Row 1 Col 3        |
  | Row 2 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        |
  | Row 3 Col 1    | :::                        | Row 2 Col 3        |

You can align the table contents, too. Just add at least two whitespaces at the opposite end of your text: Add two spaces on the left to align right, two spaces on the right to align left and two spaces at least at both ends for centered text.

^           Table with alignment           ^^^
|         right|    center    |left          |
|left          |         right|    center    |
| xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |

This is how it looks in the source:

  ^           Table with alignment           ^^^
  |         right|    center    |left          |
  |left          |         right|    center    |
  | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |

Note: Vertical alignment is not supported.
